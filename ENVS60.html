            <h2>SAMPLE WORK</h2>
            <span>In additional to oral arugmentation and presentations, weekly homework involved writing 500-700 word responses to different prompts such as mock legal briefs, summations, and mock supreme court decisions.</span>
            <p>
                <h3>Legal Brief Writing (Prof. Ross Jones @ Dartmouth)</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Assume that, because of the vocal pushback from community and environmental groups, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has conducted a supplemental EIS that includes the following additional alternatives:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A "no action" alternative</li>
                        <li>An alternative in which, instead of building a pipeline to a natural gas processing plant in Louisiana, the processing plant would be built in Port Arthur (this would require the use of eminent domain to demolish a local community, as well as the Museum of the Gulf Coast (Links to an external site).</li>
                        <li>An additional route to the Louisiana processing plant that would avoid high-property value beachfront communities (and thereby limit the possibility of leaks into the ocean) and, instead, be directly adjacent to the Louisiana Native American community (FERC notes that this is there preferred route because it will limit economic and environmental impacts (e.g., impacts on wetlands)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Also assume</strong> that the supplemental EIS still does not include an consideration of replacing the project with a renewable energy project, nor does it consider the impact of climate change on the project, or the impacts of the project on climate change (the FERC explicitly state that both impacts are too indirect to reasonably consider).
                    <br>
                    <strong>However</strong>, the supplemental EIS does consider the potential impacts of severe weather events - specifically the potential damage from a hurricane of the same strength as any in the previous 10 years.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Assume</strong> that many of same community and environmental groups who were opposed to the initial EIS remain opposed to the supplemental EIS and bring a lawsuit against the FERC, with the three claims below (in addition, assume that any group who support the original EIS - and the project - has joined FERC in the lawsuit as intervenors):
                    <ol>
                        <li>FERC violated NEPA by failing to include an inadequate range of alternatives in their supplemental EIS - particularly the use of renewable energy projects.</li>
                        <li>FERC violated NEPA by not considering the impacts of their project on climate change - and the impacts of climate change on their project</li>
                        <li>By choosing, as their preferred alternative, to place the pipeline adjacent to a Native American community, FERC has violated federal government environmental justice mandates.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    Write a 500-600 word (not counting citations) legal brief in which you address each of the three claims above
                </p>

                <h3>Judicial Opinion Writing (Prof. Ross Jones @ Dartmouth)</h3>
                <p>In this oral argument, four groups will be taking on the roles of attorneys making oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court (the fifth group) arguing for or against the three questions listed below:
                    <br><br>
                    Hypothetical background: The Dept. of Interior and the Dept. of Agriculture are jointly proposing a new rule to increase the amount of Multiple-Use Lands that can be leased to private interests for grazing, logging, mining, and fossil fuel exploration/extraction - while continuing to fulfill their statutorily required multiple-use mandates.
                    <br><br>
                    Proponents of new rule: Department of Interior/Department of Agriculture ("The Federal Government") and a Fictional NGO (Public Lands for Public Use)
                    <br><br>
                    Opponents of new rule: Native American Tribal Coalition/Earthjustice and a Fictional NGO (Hunters And Snowmobilers United)
                    <br><br>
                    **Three Questions to Argue:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Is increased mining, fossil fuel extraction and livestock grazing compatible with other mandated uses â€“ particularly biodiversity protection and recreation - as well as Native American land and natural resource rights?</li>
                        <li>Should the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) have the discretion to balance "multiple uses" differently when managing specific national forests or rangelands?</li>
                        <li>Should the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) be required to increase the amount of designated Wilderness Area and make Climate Change Mitigation/Adaptation and Biodiversity Protection the dominant uses of most U.S. National Forests and National Resources Lands (e.g., rangelands)?</li>
                    </ol>

                    As a judge for this trial, I was instructed to write a court decision evaluating the arguments in the debate.
