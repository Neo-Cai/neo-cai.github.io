            <h2>SAMPLE WORK</h2>

            <h3><strong>Essay Examples</strong></h3>
            <div>Course work consisted of writing 2 short form essays and a long form essay about International Politics. Here are two of them:</div>
            <p>
                <h4>Short Essay (Prof. William Wholforth @ Dartmouth)</h4>

                <p class="highlight-body">
                    <b>Highlight:</b> This essay highlights my ability to take an international politics concept such as realism, liberalism, etc. and apply it to real world thinking in the news. 
                </p>

                <span> Our short papers were analytical essays similar to those published by scholars in the Washington Post's Monkey Cage [TMC]. The goal, accoridng to the syllabus, is consistent with the TMC guidelines: to “illuminate the news”—in our case news having to do with international politics— “with what you know from… social science research.” We then chose any recent or current issue having to do international politics and used what we learned in this course to provide insights into the situation.</span>

                <h4>Analytical Paper (Prof. William Wholforth @ Dartmouth)</h4>
                <br>
                <span>Unlike short papers, analytical papers were meant to be long form and mirror the work of scholars publishing in journals that we have read over the course (a research paper but involving incourse material). The prompt for my paper was to "Analyze the foreign policy of a current world leader (e.g. the U.S. President, Russian President, etc.). Which theories or theoretical paradigms (e.g., realism, liberalism, constructivism) or models (security dilemma, bargaining model, Models I,II, and II or psych) help us to understand his/her foreign policy views and actions?" While we were not required to use many external sources because we could rely on the readings provided in class, I decided to use quite a few in order to explore my topic in further depth.</span>
