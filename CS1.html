                <p class="highlight-body">
                    <b>Highlight:</b> Using <b>Breadth First Search</b>, this problem challenges us to figure out how to <b>parse data, clean that data, and use it in a graphical interface</b> to find the fastest route from A to B.
                </p><br>
                <div><b>Problem: </b> I walk a lot. Not because of the gym but because of the walk <i>to</i> the gym. I used to walk to the gym the same way everyone else does. This was a rough sketch of my route: </div>

                <img src="CS1-Code\PS4\OldMap.png" alt="old route" class="demo-img">
                
                <br><div>However, this took a long time and I wanted to know how I can shave a few minutes of my walk (maybe a secret pathway). So, given the previously displayed map of the Dartmouth campus and a text file of dartmouth campus locations, I created a program to that establishes the shortest path from one campus location to another.</div>
                <p>Feel free to download the given files!</p>

                <div><b>Output:</b> This is a video demonstration of the working output finding the shortest path to the gym. Turns out I did find a shorter path! Although only by a minute or so. Still, it is valuable time for a busy person. Next I will take you through how I did this.</div><br>

                    <b>The Thought Experiment Explained:</b> (For those interested in the story beyond the code)<br>

                    <p>For TLDR, <b>read bold</b></p>

                    <p>I thought it would be interesting to base a choose your own adventure story on the fact that you can "cheat" in choose your own adventure games. From what I observed, <b>it is always in the curiosity of people to explore every possibility </b>of the story to figure out which one was the best one. </p>

                    <p><b>So, in this story, I made exploring every possibility <em>the point </em>of the story.</b> </p>

                    <p>If you don't know, <span class = "nav-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrodinger's cat</a></span> (which I may have spelled wrong in the code) is a thought experiment by Erwin Schrodinger created to demonstrate superposition. I am studying physics, but I don't know physics <em>that </em>well so, I'm just going to take the thought experiment's premise: <b>There is a cat in a box, </b>and you don't know what its state is. Its state can be dead or it's state can be alive. But, <b>as long as you don't open the box, can be dead <em>and </em>alive</b>. </p>

                    <div><img src="CS1-Code\SA9\DeadAliveCat.png" class="deadalivecat-img" width="158" ALIGN="right"></figure></div>

                    <p>Obviously, the story explores different scenarios in which,<b> in the story, you discover if the cat is alive <em>or</em> dead</b>... or alive <em>and </em>dead. <b>But </b>in some paths of the story, it is revealed to you or rather<b>, instead, you begin to realize that just as the cat can be alive or dead, you have chosen one out come over another outcome. </b></p>

                    <p>YOU are simultaneously waiting 30 more minutes for the woman to come back <em>and</em> going to the cafe to look for her. <b>So, you are Schrodinger's cat. </b>You can exist in multiple states. One where you go to the cafe, the other where you wait, and another where you never begin to accept the task at all. </p>

                    <p>And the box? Well, <b>the box is this story.</b> At first the box is unopened; the story is unexplored. ALL of the possibilities are simultaneously true. But at the same time as you are trying to figure out if the cat is alive or dead or even existent, you are also determining your own state of existence, where you are, and what "timeline" you go. </p>

                    <p>And again, just as Schrodinger's cat can be either alive, dead, and non-existent, your ability to test every possible outcome means you can be with a living cat, a dead one, or a non-existent one all at the same time. <b>Cheating the story and backtracking <em>is</em> the simultaneous existence of every branch of the story.</b></p>

                    <p>Btw, I don't know quantum physics (yet), I just took a phrase about Schrodinger and ran with it.</p>

                <h3 id="OOP"><strong>The Magic Trick of Making Cards and Decks</strong></h3> (Short Assignment Example)
                <p>While magicians make cards and decks of cards dissapear, Python already does not have cards or decks. So before we do our magic card tricks, deal them, shuffle them, etc. we need to make the cards in the first place. This, is the "appearing" card trick.</p>
                <p class="highlight-body">
                    <b>Highlight:</b> to practice <b>object oriented programming,</b> We are given code that simulate actions in a deck of cards. You can say <code class="language-python">deck.shuffle</code> and the cards in the deck will shuffle. But! Python doesn't include a card class or a deck class. So, How do we make this code work? We need to write our own card and deck classses to create such objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Problem:</b> Here is some given code for us to dedeuce what the deck and card class needs. In each suit, there are 13 card values: cards with numbers 1 through 10, the Jack (11), the Queen (12), and the King (13). A standard deck has 52 cards: one of each value, for each suit. (We ignore the Joker.) Each of the actions are outlined in the comments of the given test code.
