                    I am currently a student at Dartmouth College who is somewhat indecisive about my major. Physics and computer science have become a renewed interest to me since I have met so many interesting people and learned a lot since high school. At the same time, I have a lot of fun writing about critical literature so I am happy to explore anything at this point. Importantly, I hate schedules but I love organization and I live for the <i>ding</i> sound when I check things off my Microsoft ToDo list.

                    <b>How to Use the Site: </b>
                     The way I have organized my work in this website is by class and based on the order of the times when I took each class. Each row has a "More Info" button which will take you to another page about the class including some of my sample work and a link to more of the work I have done for the class in a google drive. You can directly access the entire drive in the tab above. In addition, there is a tab for my blog, a Dartmouth provided space where I also demo some of my projects more casually. For a quick summary of my information, I have also provided my resume.
                     <br><br>
                     <b>Purpose: </b>This website is in part a way for me to teach myself HTML and CSS (maybe Java script) and in part to organize the collection of work that I have/will be doing throughout my time at Dartmouth College.
